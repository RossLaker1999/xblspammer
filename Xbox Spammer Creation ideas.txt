Xbox Spammer Creation ideas

Include -

1. Clean nice panel
2. Ability to add/remove api keys
3. Make each api key send a message to a specific user
4. Allow for a username to be entered for XUID lookup and saved to that username for future commands (API uses xuid to id profiles over usernames)
5. Allow for a custom message and time spacing between message sends.
6. Allow for a option to use all api keys for the messages or just a specific api key
7. Set up a persistent ssh server or website this script can be ran form that looks very nice and detailed.
8. Add account reporting option
9. Add a party invite option to start a party on my xbox using one of the api keys provide for ip pulling
10. Add a rage bait option for banning (Trolls them into raging through messages or part invite spamming)
11. Ability to create xbl.io account and get the API key (Might not be possible.)
12. Keep adding to the API register with more and more accounts create a botnet like army of api key
13. Discord bot integration 

(Make this a multi day project keep enhancing and adding features eventually implement into GitHub. Could possibly sell as a service)
